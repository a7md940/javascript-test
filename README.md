We have a list that gets so many insertions and deletions at a small amount of time
to obtain good preformance for our software we use a fine tuned data sturcture with a combination of algorithms to get the best performance when sorting, inserting, removing, finding items in the list.

This repo contains two files:

- index.js: where you should add your implementation.
- index.test.js: you should start by adding unit tests to cover the rest of the required methods.
- index.naive.js: that files contains a naive poorly performing implmentation you can look at and optimize.
